This bachelor thesis is the results of five months of work at the NTNU Trondheim in Norway. I would like to thank my supervisor, professor doctor Jacob Linder
for his guidance and support during this period, and for introducing me to an interesting branch of physics. Thanks to professor doctor Wolfgang Belzig for 
correcting this work.\\

This thesis concludes for me three years of study at the University of Constance in Germany. The way until here had many pitfalls and difficulties, and I am very grateful to 
you papa and maman, as well as to my brothers, Massa, Idriss and Vegar, for their encouragement and their kindness during our phone calls and visits. The chocolate and drawings you put in these packages
always brought me to smile! I want to express my gratitude to my grandparents for their support, their stories and delicious meals during my visits. I am also thankful
to my uncles for their great hospitality and helping me find the way in the adulthood. All the moments seeing the family felt very peaceful.

Thanks to Kai and Jakob for their friendship and interesting discussions we shared at lunch around a ``Seezeitteller''. Thanks to Kim and Luca 
in Trondheim for our trips and your smiles. Finally, I am very grateful to you Tom, for all the times we went out in the city, built projects,
watched movies, shared breakfast. I still do not understand why you need to put the butter in a dedicated container. 
To our deep discussions and stupid jokes. You showed me how life can be great when you use of boldness towards the `no balls' situations.
Your friendship is precious to me.
