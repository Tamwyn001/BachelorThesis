This bachelor thesis is the results of five months of work at the NTNU Trondheim in Norway. I would like to thank my supervisor, professor doctor Jacob Linder
for his guidance and support during this period, and for introducing me to an interesting branch of physics. Thanks to professor doctor Wolfgang Belzig for 
correcting this work.\\

This thesis concludes for me three years of study at the University of Constance in Germany. The way until here had many pitfalls and difficulties, and I am very grateful to my
parents and brothers for their encouragement and their kindness during our phone calls and visits. The chocolate and drawings you put in these packages
always brought me to smile!

Thanks to my grandparents for their support, their stories and delicious meals

Thanks to Kai and Jakob for their friendship and interesting discussions we shared at lunch around a ``Seezeitteller''.
