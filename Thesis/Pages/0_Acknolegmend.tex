In this work, we simulated the leaking of the Cooper-pairs of a BCS superconductor \cite{FossheimSudbo2004} in an altermagnet \cite{Smejkal2022} using the tight binding and
Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism. The simulations were performed in a lattice of $40\times30$ sites being used.
We found that the leaking decreases exponentially the more we penetrate the altermagnet, and is modulated by oscillations.
Moreover, the leaking is stronger for lower $|\mu|$, with $\mu$ the chemical potential. The presence of the Cooper pairs were the highest where 
the Fermi-surface shares the most area with the superconducting gap. The use of a straight or diagonal interface
between the superconductor and the altermagnet was found to have an influence on the leaking. Along the interface's normal, the leaking experiences less oscillations
in the case of a diagonal interface. Due to the presence of vacuum on the side of the system, we were able to see some Friedel oscillations, as well as
the presence of Andrev bound states.

We simulated as well the current induced by a phase gradient in the superconducting gap parameter $\Delta$.
The current was found proportional to the phase gradient as predicted by \cite{Orlando2003},
and is stronger the more the Cooper-pairs are present.

Finally, we simulated the $d$-wave superconductivity \cite{Mjos2019} in a superconductor described by the Hartree-Fock approximation.
The same lattice was used, and we found that the pairs are more present at lower $|\mu|$.

This bachelor thesis is the results of five months of work at the NTNU Trondheim in Norway. I would like to thank my supervisor, professor doctor Jacob W. Linder
for his guidance and support during this period, and for introducing me to an interesting branch of physics. Thanks to professor doctor Wolfgang Belzig for 
correcting this work, and Timo Oppl for his review.\\

This thesis concludes for me three years of study at the University of Constance in Germany. The way until here had many pitfalls and difficulties, and I am very grateful to 
you papa and mama, as well as to my brothers, Massa, Idriss and Vegar, for their encouragement and their kindness during our phone calls and visits. The chocolate and drawings you put in these packages
always brought me to smile! I want to express my gratitude to my grandparents for their support, their stories and delicious meals during my visits. I am also thankful
to my uncles for their great hospitality and helping me find the way in the adulthood. All the moments seeing the family felt very peaceful.

Thanks to Kai and Jakob for their friendship and interesting discussions we shared at lunch around a ``Seezeitteller''. Thanks to Kim and Luca 
in Trondheim for our trips and your smiles. Finally, I am very grateful to you Tom, for all the times we went out in the city, built projects,
watched movies, shared breakfast. I still do not understand why you need to put the butter in a dedicated container. 
To our deep discussions and stupid jokes. You showed me how life can be great when you use of boldness towards the `no balls' situations.
Your friendship is precious to me.
