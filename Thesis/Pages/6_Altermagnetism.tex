\section{Altermagnetism}
\subsection{Introduction and overview}
The reader might already be familiar with ferromagnets and all the regular magnetic models. Taking into account the spin and
wave vector of each particle in a site, one can derive some symmetries under transform operations. For example a
ferromagnet is symmetric under spin-flip (also called time reversal) and a rotation. In the example of the antiferromagnetism,
we have two sub-lattice with opposite spins. In such systems the spin compensate each other resulting in a null magnetization.
The system is symmetric under spin-flip and translation and was theorized in 1948 by Louis Néel as the Néel antiferromagnets \cite{Neel1936}.
Allowing more complexity one could imagine multiple ions in a unit cell linked by rotation, screw, etc symmetries. The half ions 
of the cell owns an opposite spin from the other half. The spectra compensate each other resulting in a zero net magnetization.
Moreover, these mediums keep same electron spectra under such transformations, making them the same as Néel's antiferromagnets.
These material are labelled as zero $q$ antiferromagnets.
This section summarizes the historical work of \cite{Mazin2024}.\\

Altermagnets implement two or more sub-lattice which are not related between each other by translation or inversion.
Since these operations are known to conserve the electrons spectra, we observe a band splitting of the spectra with respect to the spins.
These class of material was pinpointed in 2019 \cite{Hayami2019}. The symmetry that actually links these sublattices is a rotation,
along with a spin-polarisation in the momentum space linked with a rotation as well \cite{Smejkal2022}.
We observe an alternating sign in the spin-splitted momenta, as well as an alternating spin polarization in the real space,
which leads to the name altermagnetism \cite{Smejkal2022_2}. 
\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{The altermagnet shares similar properties with the antiferromagnets like two sublattices of opposite spin, resulting in a zero net
    magnetization. Whereas the antiferromagnet's sublattices are liked by a translation $t$ and a space inversion $\mathcal{P}$, in the altermagnet one can link
    each sublattice with a rotation, here labelled as $\mathcal{C}$. We observe as well an alternating sign in the energy spectra of both altermagnet's sublattices
     \cite{Smejkal2022}\cite{Stonebraker}.}
\end{figure}


These properties put the altermagnet in between
the conventional dichotomy of ferromagnets and antiferromagnet. In fact the altermagnet compensate its magnetical moments taking advantage of the two
sublattices, like the antiferromagnet does. On the other hand it shares similar properties with the ferromagnets, such as anomalous Hall effect,
spin current \cite{Naka2021_2}, magneto-electric effect \cite{Smejkal2022_3}, tunnelling magnetoresistance \cite{Smejkal2022_4} among other \cite{Smejkal2022_2}.\\

Now that we have a better understanding of altermagnetism we can compare it with another class of material, where the sublattices
aren't linked with the conventional crystal symmetries.
As a consequence summing up the spin might not result in a trivial expression like the antiferromagnetic material. In fact the overall
spin projection might almost be zero but not exactly. However, studying half metal and insulator leads to different result.
Half metal can be seen as an insulator in one spin channel 
but not both \cite{Mazin2024}. The Quin Luttinger's theorem, showed that such substance must have an integer number of Bohr spin
magnetic moment. Therefore, structures with a small net magnetization see these quantities be floored to zero. \\

A few materials seem to exhibit these properties. 1D material won't work because of lack of rotation possibilities. A diverse list of two and three-dimensional 
materials were listed by \cite{Smejkal2022} such as semimetals with a Cr$_2$O monolayer \cite{Chen_2023}, a variety of insulators like 
 perovskite oxide LaMnO$_3$ \cite{Yuan2021} CaCrO$_3$ \cite{Naka2021}, ferrite  Fe$_2$O$_3$ \cite{Smejkal2022_2}, or organic insulators $\kappa$-Cl \cite{Naka2019}.
We find as well the chalcogenide MnTe semiconductor \cite{Smejkal2022_2}.

On the seek of practical application, researchers have found (an exhaustive list is provided in \cite{Mazin2024}) that
domain like tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) are limited under the properties of the material. For instance the actual use 
of ferromagnets limits the frequency to the gigahertz range \rem{check the values at \url{https://www.nature.com/articles/158670a0}}.
This has to deal with the ferromagnetic resonance that connects 
the magnetization with electromagnetic waves. The altermagnets could be used in the terahertz range.
Mentioning that TMR is a key component of the magnetic random access memory (MRAM) \cite{OSullivan2004}\cite{Yadav2022}, the reader can easily estimate the performance
improvement such upgrade could deliver in a computer.\\
 
After this introduction on altermagnets, we intend to find a way to implement these into our system. In a more formal way, we can
distinguish two types of altermagnet.
In the first type, the altermagnet's lattice site have different distance to the neighbours depending on the linking axis and the 
spin of the particle in the site. This is illustrated in Fig.\ref{fig:altermagnet_lattice} $(\bm{a})$. On the other hand we can consider a unit cell being unsymmetrical
in its ion position. We consider a square lattice were each unit cell has a non-magnetic ion and two magnetic ions with opposite spin.
Please consider the second schema $(\bm{b})$.\\

\subsection{Symmetries}
After giving an introduction on the geometric background of altermagnet we can now focus on the symmetries of the material. In this section
we are going to focus on two simple transformation. The inversion $P$ and the spin flip (time reversal) $T$ which are broadly discussed in the literature \cite{Smejkal2022}\cite{Smejkal2022_2}.
\begin{alignat*}{2}
    P : \bm{r} &\mapsto -\bm{r} ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &~~~\realnum^3 \rightarrow \realnum^3, \\
    T : t &\mapsto -t  ~\hat{=} ~\sigma \mapsto -\sigma &\realnum \rightarrow \realnum.~
\end{alignat*}
We can first asume that the energy $\epsilon$ of the particle (or band structure) depends on the spin $\sigma$ and the wave vector $\bm{k}$. Using $\bm{p} = \dd \bm{r}/\dd t$ and the de Broglie hypothesis 
$\bm{p} = \hbar\bm{k}$ \cite{Broglie1924} leads to: 
\begin{align*}
    P \bigl(\epsilon(\bm{k}, \sigma)\bigr) &= \epsilon(-\bm{k}, \sigma)\\
    T \bigl(\epsilon(\bm{k}, \sigma)\bigr) &= \epsilon(-\bm{k}, -\sigma)
\end{align*}
We observe the $PT$ operation $P\circ T$. If the system is $PT$ symmetric one should get $\epsilon(\bm{k}, \sigma)= P\circ T\bigl(\epsilon(\bm{k}, \sigma)\bigr)$.
Assuming it's the case we can write
\[
    \epsilon(\bm{k}, \sigma)= P\circ T\bigl(\epsilon(\bm{k}, \sigma)\bigr) =  \epsilon(\bm{k}, \downarrow)
\] 
and therefore the $PT$-symmetric systems are spin-degenerated. We have the same energy for a given momentum at two opposite spins.
 Reciprocally this means that the existence 
of $ \epsilon(\bm{k}, \sigma)$ is followed by an observation of $ \epsilon(\bm{k}, -\sigma)$.\\

\paragraph{A few examples}
We can imagine having a small lattice section for the seek of readability. We consider a ferromagnetic lattice where we apply the space inversion
in the middle where the black cross is. The arrows represent the spin and the overall sign of the wave vector $\bm{k}$ is given under each state. Moreover, 
we use the shading to keep track of the real space location of the site. This representation is in the real space.\\

The relevant variables for the symmetry in the spectrum are the spin projection and the momentum. We see however that the spin are flipped before and after the PT-operation.
Letting the spin points downwards again will require to use an additional operation. Therefore, the ferromagnet is not $PT$-symmetric, and we observe no spin degeneracy as the
equation shows it.\\

The antiferromagnet has a spin switch in every direction. Here when choosing a point to apply our operations to, we see that 
neither a lattice point nor a point in the middle on two sites lead to a PT symmetry. As we see the spins points in different directions.

This point we apply the $P$ transformation around makes the antiferromagnets having a PT symmetry. We see that the lattice site have moved but only the spin and
the wave vector takes part to the band $\epsilon$. We therefore have a degeneracy in the energy spectrum. Finding at least one point where the PT 
symmetry works makes the system PT symmetric.\\

If we now take a look at an altermagnets pictured in Fig.\ref{fig:altermagnet_lattice}, we have two different models to test. In the first one $\bm{(a)}$
the effect of the time reversal $T$ makes the hopping change $m\rightarrow -m$. Then we find no point
to invert the system around so that this first model doesn't have a PT symmetry. For the second one $\bm{(b)}$
we can first invert all spin but afterwards inverting the space doesn't bring back the system in the original configuration.
In fact neither applying the $P$ after $T$ on the lattice point nor on the space in-between leads to the lattice we began with. In both cases the 
degeneracy is lifted, we have dissimilar energies for the different spin-orientation. This is the reason for the band splitting we discussed in the introducing 
paragraph.\\

\paragraph{Beyond the scope} $~$ We refer as spin-orbit coupling (SOC) the interaction between the spin of the electron and the orbital motion. 
When SOC is discarded we observe a rotation symmetry around the spins. A rotation $R$ can turn the spin back after the application of $T$
resulting in a $RT$ symmetry. $RT\bigl(\epsilon(\bm{k},\sigma)\bigr) = \epsilon(-\bm{k},\sigma)$ must equal $\epsilon(\bm{k},\sigma)$.\\

If we now consider a collinear magnet without SOC, we have a $RT$ but no $PT$ symmetry. Under such circumstances the spin-splitting must be symmetric under 
$\epsilon(-\bm{k},\sigma) = \epsilon(\bm{k},\sigma)$ which describes an even band structure. Such systems are called inversion symmetric altermagnets.\\

\subsection{Implementation of an altermagnet}
After introducing the basic properties of an altermagnet we now aim to describe this system with the already introduced formalism.
We are going to consider the first model involving a spin-dependent hopping. The Hamiltonian is given by \cite{Ouassou2023} as:
\begin{equation*}
    H_{AM} = -\sum_{\langle i, j\rangle\sigma\sigma'} \left(\bm{m}_{ij} \cdot \bm{\sigma}\right)_{\sigma\sigma'} c_{i\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{j\sigma'} 
\end{equation*}
involving $\bm{\sigma}=(\sigma_1, \sigma_2,\sigma_3)^T$ the Pauli matrices. $\bm{m}_{ij}$ is the actual spin dependent hopping term. If the connection line 
between the two sites $i$ and $j$ lies on the $\bm{e}_x$ axis, we have $\bm{m}_{ij} = m(0,0,1)$ and $\bm{m}_{ji} = m(0,0,-1)$ along $\bm{e}_y$. $m$ is 
the desired hopping amplitude, and $\bm{m}_{ij}$ scales and masks the Pauli matrices. $\sigma_3$ puts $m$ on the diagonal, and takes care of the sign switch. 
Now having the normal metal t-hopping and this term leads to the $t\pm m$ we
described in Fig.\ref{fig:altermagnet_lattice} (\textbf{a}).\\

Since the BdG formalism uses fermionic operators, we again need to bring the matrix in a way that reflects the fermionic properties with regard to the $\check{c}$ operator.
We can remake use of Eq.\ref{eq:Trick1}:
\begin{equation*}
    H_{AM} = -\sum_{\langle i j\rangle\sigma\sigma'} \left(\bm{m}_{ij} \cdot \bm{\sigma}\right)_{\sigma\sigma'} \frac{1}{2}\left(c_{i\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{j\sigma'} - c_{i\sigma'}c_{j\sigma}^{\dagger}\right).
\end{equation*}
For the last summand we split the sum, exchanged the labelling of the states $i$ and $j$ and recombined the sums. However, due to the matrix element in the front
that we want to factorize with, we can't exchange the labellings of $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$.
Bringing this Hamiltonian in the Nambu formalism we obtain by defining
$\left(\bm{m}_{ij} \cdot \bm{\sigma}\right)_{\sigma\sigma'} = \mathcal{M}_{\sigma\sigma'}$ 
the following Hamiltonian:
\begin{equation*}
    H^{(AM)}_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}\begin{pmatrix}
        -\mathcal{M} & \mathcal{O}\\
        \mathcal{O} & \mathcal{M}^T
    \end{pmatrix}
    ,~~~ \text{where} ~~~ \mathcal{M} = \begin{pmatrix}
        \mathcal{M}_{\uparrow\uparrow} & \mathcal{M}_{\uparrow\downarrow}\\
        \mathcal{M}_{\downarrow\uparrow} & \mathcal{M}_{\downarrow\downarrow}\\
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation*}
Making use of this matrix in an altermagnetic lattice point, we can generate the according eigenvectors and -values. We can then study how the physical quantities 
behave in this material.\\
