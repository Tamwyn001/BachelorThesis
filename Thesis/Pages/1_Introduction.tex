\paragraph{Introduction}


Fist a few words about the notation. When having multiple indices under a symbol we ommit the comma to make the notation more readable. 
For example, $x_{ij}$ is the same as $x_{i,j}$. However when we have complexer indices such as $x_{i-1, j}$, we keep the comma between all
the indicies.\\

We are going to use Hilbert-space's operators. As often in physics they will be mutliplied with the wavefunction. This is the case for the Hamiltonian 
operator for example. However the second quantisation opertors works diffently. We will give a proper definition when the moment comes.
