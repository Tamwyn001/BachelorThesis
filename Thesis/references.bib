abstract={The research in the field of superconductivity has led to the synthesis of superconducting materials with features that allow you to expand the applicability of this kind of materials. Among the superconducting materials characteristics, the critical temperature of the superconductor is framing the range and type of industrial applications that can benefit from them. Some examples of industrial applications incorporating superconducting materials stand out in this paper. Among other possibilities, the nuclear magnetic resonance, the magnetic levitation train, the transport processing of electrical energy (motors, generators, transformers and power lines) and superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) systems are already solutions contributing to the nowadays daily life, but more than that, are solutions that will contribute to improve the quality of life of many human beings in the near future. In addition to these solutions, in this paper are presented and discussed the pros and cons of a solution designed for the fast field cycling nuclear magnetic resonance technique that benefits of the usage of superconducting blocks.},

Samples withx=1 and 0.75,y>0, annealed below 900{\textdegree}C under reducing conditions, consist of three phases, one of them a perovskite-like mixed-valent copper compound. Upon cooling, the samples show a linear decrease in resistivity, then an approximately logarithmic increase, interpreted as a beginning of localization. Finally an abrupt decrease by up to three orders of magnitude occurs, reminiscent of the onset of percolative superconductivity. The highest onset temperature is observed in the 30 K range. It is markedly reduced by high current densities. Thus, it results partially from the percolative nature, bute possibly also from 2D superconducting fluctuations of double perovskite layers of one of the phases present.},

Doiron-Leyraud et al. report the observation of a Fermi surface in a high-temperature superconductor, a phenomenon regarded as the classic signature of a metal. Gomes et al. tackled the long-standing question of whether the gap in the electronic energy spectrum at temperatures above the critical temperature of a high-temperature superconductor is associated with electron pairing. They find that it is. With these two elegant experimental papers adding some solid new data to the mix, it is the turn of the theorists to work out the implications for superconductivity mechanisms.},
