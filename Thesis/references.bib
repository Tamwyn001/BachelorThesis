abstract={The research in the field of superconductivity has led to the synthesis of superconducting materials with features that allow you to expand the applicability of this kind of materials. Among the superconducting materials characteristics, the critical temperature of the superconductor is framing the range and type of industrial applications that can benefit from them. Some examples of industrial applications incorporating superconducting materials stand out in this paper. Among other possibilities, the nuclear magnetic resonance, the magnetic levitation train, the transport processing of electrical energy (motors, generators, transformers and power lines) and superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) systems are already solutions contributing to the nowadays daily life, but more than that, are solutions that will contribute to improve the quality of life of many human beings in the near future. In addition to these solutions, in this paper are presented and discussed the pros and cons of a solution designed for the fast field cycling nuclear magnetic resonance technique that benefits of the usage of superconducting blocks.},
